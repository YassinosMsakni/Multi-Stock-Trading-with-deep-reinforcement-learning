# Multi-Stock-Trading-with-deep-reinforcement-learning
In deep reinforcement learning for stock trading, the agent goal is to learn a policy for making buy, sell, or hold actions for a given stock based on historical price data and technical indicators such as RSI, MACD... The agent interacts with the stock market environment and receives rewards or penalties based on the returns from the actions it takes.
Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state space represents the information available to the agent, the action space represents the buy, sell, or hold actions, and the reward function is designed to reflect the financial objectives of the trader. The policy function, which maps states to actions, is learned by the agent through reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-Learning or Policy Gradients.
